# Computer Tech Final Project

This is a project for the Coumpter Technology Course in which we were tasked to create a Real-Life contraption and intergrate RaspberryPi or Arduino into it. This project is the combination of Coding skills and Circuit building skills that we learned throughout the course.

For this project, Myself (Aariz) and Asim decided to partner up as we believe we would have more success doing so.

For more information on topics such as the project, refer to the *Project Info* page.
