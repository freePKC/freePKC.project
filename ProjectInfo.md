The project my partner and I decided to go with was a simple car indicator. We decided to make this car indicator a **Sequential LED Indicator** which provided **Dynamic LED Motion**. 
The way it works is when the switch is flicked to the right direction, one of the four LED's towards the right of the switch would light up, then the next and the one after till all are lit up. This process then repeats for a duration of 10 Seconds.
The same will happen when the switch is flicked on to the left.
